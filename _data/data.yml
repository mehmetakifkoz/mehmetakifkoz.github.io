            During my internship at Corizo from, I gained practical experience in machine learning, covering various aspects of the field under the mentorship of Abin Varghese. The highlight of my internship was the Flight Ticket Price Predictor (FTPP) project, where I engaged in data cleaning, exploration, model building, and evaluation. This hands-on experience significantly complemented my academic knowledge, providing me with insights into real-world applications of machine learning.

            During my Machine Learning training at Corizo, under the guidance of Data Scientist Abin Varghese, I underwent an extensive program covering fundamental concepts in machine learning and data science. The training began with an induction session, providing an overview of machine learning fundamentals. Following this, I received a brief introduction to machine learning, learned Python for Data Science, explored NumPy and pandas, and delved into specialized topics such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Clustering techniques including K-Means & DBSCAN. Each session contributed to building my expertise in machine learning, equipping me with practical skills for data analysis and modeling.

      - title: YOGURT FERMENTATION MONITORING WITH IOT AND MACHINE LEARNING
        link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CrYAOwg8wdZZC0iEhzG3kGV0NicBu9X5/view?usp=drivesdk
        tagline: "This study investigates the potential of using temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) derived Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurements, to predict the pH value during yogurt fermentation. A device was developed to collect real-time data on pH, temperature, and TDS. Additionally, a user interface hosted on Amazon Lightsail was provided to display sensor values, enhancing accessibility and monitoring of the fermentation process. Experiments conducted using factory milk in a laboratory setting revealed a high degree of correlation between the collected TDS and pH values at identical temperature points. Data from these experiments were used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, incorporating temperature and TDS as features and pH as target. The model was optimized using a Keras-based hyperparameter optimizer, which adjusted the network's layers and nodes. The LSTM model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of less than 0.026, indicating reliable performance in converting measured TDS and temperature data into pH predictions. This suggests that indirect, non-invasive pH measurements are possible with a special fermentation chamber."
