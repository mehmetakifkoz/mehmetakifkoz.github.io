            During my Machine Learning training at Corizo, under the guidance of Data Scientist Abin Varghese, I underwent an extensive program covering fundamental concepts in machine learning and data science. The training began with an induction session, providing an overview of machine learning fundamentals. Following this, I received a brief introduction to machine learning, learned Python for Data Science, explored NumPy and pandas, and delved into specialized topics such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Clustering techniques including K-Means & DBSCAN. Each session contributed to building my expertise in machine learning, equipping me with practical skills for data analysis and modeling.

      - title: YOGURT FERMENTATION MONITORING WITH IOT AND MACHINE LEARNING
        link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CrYAOwg8wdZZC0iEhzG3kGV0NicBu9X5/view?usp=drivesdk
        tagline: "This study investigates the potential of using temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) derived Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurements, to predict the pH value during yogurt fermentation. A device was developed to collect real-time data on pH, temperature, and TDS. Additionally, a user interface hosted on Amazon Lightsail was provided to display sensor values, enhancing accessibility and monitoring of the fermentation process. Experiments conducted using factory milk in a laboratory setting revealed a high degree of correlation between the collected TDS and pH values at identical temperature points. Data from these experiments were used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, incorporating temperature and TDS as features and pH as target. The model was optimized using a Keras-based hyperparameter optimizer, which adjusted the network's layers and nodes. The LSTM model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of less than 0.026, indicating reliable performance in converting measured TDS and temperature data into pH predictions. This suggests that indirect, non-invasive pH measurements are possible with a special fermentation chamber."
